#Purpose of Project#
This project was created for the purpose of revising how to use GitHub.  Specifically it enabled revision of:-
+ How to create a repository
+ The options to select when creating a repository
+ How to create a README.md file
+ How to make a first commit for a readme file
+ How to make a start with your code
Note because this was a test file for practice and revision only there are no other files in this repo apart from this README.md file
